# 📊 Internship Task 1 – Data Exploration and Preprocessing

This repository contains my submission for **Task 1** of the **Data Science Internship** at **Cognifyz Technologies**.

---

## 📝 Task Objective

> Explore the dataset and perform preprocessing steps to prepare it for further analysis or modeling.

### ✅ Key Steps Completed:

1. **Loaded the dataset**
2. **Explored the shape** – identified number of rows and columns
3. **Checked for missing values** in all columns
4. **Handled missing values** appropriately:
   - Categorical columns like `Cuisines` had missing values, which were dropped due to small count (9 rows)
5. **Performed data type conversion** where necessary (e.g., converted `Aggregate rating` to numeric)
6. **Analyzed the distribution** of the target variable (`Aggregate rating`) using a histogram
7. **Identified class imbalance** in the target column (many records with 0.0 rating)
